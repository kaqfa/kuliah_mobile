I would like to thank everyone for downloading Aeolus HD. I also want to thank the people at XDA forums who have contributed to the pack using the .PSD

Thank you for downloading the first extenstion pack to Aeolus HD. I'm not done yet, still have more icons coming!

This pack was created to bring people more of Aeolus HD, previously released and some not released icons I've made.

The set contains 75, 125x125 icons in .PNG format. Some of the icons have alternates. The set may be used as a theme for launchers such as 'Go Launcher', 'Sweeter Home', 'ADW Ex' or roms such as MIUI.
